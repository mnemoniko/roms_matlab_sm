# roms_matlab_sm
Personal Matlab functions for use with ROMS

Objective:
Share a series of Matlab functions written for use with input and output from the Regional Ocean Modelling System (myroms.org).  Several of these are designed to replicate published functions, but have changes to accommodate an ice shelf.

Status:
Current versions of files are missing necessary checks and work only on (my own) specific file systems.
